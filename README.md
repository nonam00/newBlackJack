## Blackjack Rules

Blackjack is a popular card game also known as 21. The basic rules of the game are as follows:
+ The goal of the game is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.
+ Number cards are worth their face value, face cards are worth 10, and an ace can be worth 1 or 11.
+ The game begins with each player, including the dealer, receiving two cards.
+ Players can choose to "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current total).
+ If a player's total goes over 21, they bust and lose the game.
+ After all players have either busted or stood, the dealer reveals their hand and hits or stands according to set rules.
+ The player with a higher total than the dealer without exceeding 21 wins the game.
